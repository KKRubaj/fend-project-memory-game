## Instructions

### How The Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen "cards", it means eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly with the symbol face down.

The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The player starts with 3 stars. After 16 moves the number of stars decreases to 2 stars, then above 23 moves only 1 star remains. Fewer moves mean better stars rating.

A restart button allows the player to reset the game board.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched. The player receives a message with the result - how many stars he scored, how many moves he made and how much time it took him and possibility to play again.

## How to play?

Click the card to display its sign. Find the second identical card. You win if you discover all 8 sign pairs. If you do this in 15 or less moves you will get 3 super stars. It means that your memory is amazing, but practice it in every free moment.
Warning: this game can be addictive.
